      <description>Once upon a time There was a operating system called Ubuntu 14.04, I tried installing tensorflow gpu on that. And I was stuck in login loop as Tom cruise was stuck in time loop in the movie &amp;ldquo;The Edge of tomorrow&amp;rdquo;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get out of login loop until I installed Ubuntu 16.04
Want to know how was my experience with ubuntu 16.04 In a very few[sarcastic laugh] steps I was able to install it.</description>
