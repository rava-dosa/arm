<h3 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h3>
<p>As per however small my perspective is the I think writing mapper and reducer is not the big-deal, What the most most important thing is data preprocessing, that is how you are gonna provide data to the jar file. To preprocess the data you have to think about what your key value will be, and how your data is. You can&rsquo;t expect your data to be clean and formatted, and you have to take care of every edge case there. Just imagine you are doing matrix multiplication but if some of your individual no&rsquo;s is greater than you ram total address space then, you might be in big trouble(I tried copying once 1 hd movie by opening it in sublime and the ctl+a, ctrl+c, it&rsquo;s not pleasent), then you have to precalculate your multiplication step as well put it as key and by using job control chain two map reduce task. I went a little offroad above,as you give one one line to one mapper so how would you like to provide that one line, what if for matrix multiplication you provide one such as, <strong>a[1,1] b[1,1] b[2,1]&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. a[1,2] b[1,1] b[2,1] &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</strong> now as you know both matrix parameters you can be assured that (we can use bash variable to store local variable as well but there is distributed cache as well) one mapper can write key value pair as <strong>Key&lt;1,1&gt; a[1,1]b[1,1], Key&lt;1,1&gt; a[1,2]b[2,1], &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</strong> And in reducer step you can just add all the key value pair to get something like <strong>Key&lt;1,1&gt; sumof(i=&gt;1-&gt;n)a[1,i]b[i,1]</strong>.</p>
