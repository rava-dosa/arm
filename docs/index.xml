Let&amp;rsquo;s start Where we should/&amp;lsquo;nt use Apache spark ? Spark wasnâ€™t made with online transaction processing ( OLTP ) applications in mind (fast, numerous, atomic transactions). Itâ€™s better suited for online analytical processing ( OLAP ): batch jobs and data mining.</description>

      <description>Architecture of Linux kernel {:class=&amp;ldquo;img-responsive&amp;rdquo;}
Before We start This series is neither totally theoritical nor totally hands-on. It is amalgammation of both. Just the way I think. You will not become expert which should be implied.
Adding a new module in linux kernel So linux kernel is a monolithic kernel. To be accurate it is Modular monolithic. Monolithic term in kernal is used in the sense of permission of code running there.</description>

What is Syscall ? System call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time There was a operating system called Ubuntu 14.04, I tried installing tensorflow gpu on that. And I was stuck in login loop as Tom cruise was stuck in time loop in the movie &amp;ldquo;The Edge of tomorrow&amp;rdquo;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get out of login loop until I installed Ubuntu 16.04
Want to know how was my experience with ubuntu 16.04 In a very few[sarcastic laugh] steps I was able to install it.</description>

Preprocessing As per however small my perspective is the I think writing mapper and reducer is not the big-deal, What the most most important thing is data preprocessing, that is how you are gonna provide data to the jar file.</description>

      <description>According to wikipedia Profile-guided optimization (PGO, sometimes pronounced as pogo), also known as profile-directed feedback (PDF) and feedback-directed optimization (FDO) is a compiler optimization technique in computer programming that uses profiling to improve program runtime performance.
What it really means again from wikipedia:- Optimization techniques based on analysis of the source code.
How to do it ? Read it AutoFDO tutorial
