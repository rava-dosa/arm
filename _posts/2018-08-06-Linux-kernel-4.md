### Before We start
This series is neither totally theoritical nor totally hands-on. It is amalgammation of both. Just the way I think. You will not become expert which should be implied.  
### ?
Here's a useless table:

| Commands | Description |
| :------ | :----------------------- |
| fs –help ls | lists the usage information along with the options to use the command |
| fs –ls –R /user/username | Returns all the available files and recursively lists all the subdirectories under /user/username |
| fs –mkdir /user/username/directory-name | create a new directory |
| fs –copyFromLocal Sample1.txt /user/username/destination-address | 
| fs –put Sample2.txt /user/username/destination-address | uploads a single file or multiple source files from local file system to hadoop distributed file system |
| fs –moveFromLocal Sample1.txt /user/username/destination-address | deletes original and copy |
