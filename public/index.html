Let&rsquo;s start Where we should/&lsquo;nt use Apache spark ? Spark wasn’t made with online transaction processing ( OLTP ) applications in mind (fast, numerous, atomic transactions). It’s better suited for online analytical processing ( OLAP ): batch jobs and data mining.&hellip;

What is Syscall ? System call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.&hellip;
